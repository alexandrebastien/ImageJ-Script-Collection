This tool allows to use the mouse to modify min and max as well as a gamma correction in the look-up table (LUT). Contrary to Process > Math > Gamma, this tool does not affect the pixels values. It only changes the LUT which is stored in image meta data. Right click on the tool to access options. Modify the max by clicking and moving up and down, use ctrl-click to modify the min, shift-click to modify gamma. Use alt to modify faster.
